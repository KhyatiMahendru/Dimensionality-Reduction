# Dimensionality-Reduction
This is an implementation of 3 dimensionality reduction techniques - PCA, SVD, and tSNE for visualization of high dimensional data in 2D and 3D.  

In this notebook, I have used 3 methods of Dimensionality Reduction:

- Principal Component Analysis
- Singular Value Decomposition
- t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding

I have used these techniques on two datasets:

- The Digits Dataset from sklearn
- MNIST Dataset - The "Hello World" of Computer Vision
